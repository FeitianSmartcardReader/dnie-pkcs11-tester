# dnie-pkcs11-tester

This program is just a lttle PKCS#11 tester for the DNIe (Spanish eID). It is intended to be used with the pkcs11 library provided by Opensc.

The auto-tools can be used for compilng it. You need the the PKCS#11 library provided by OpenSC (or another one if you are testing another implementation) and openssl installed in your machine.

    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure --with-pkcs11=/path/to/pkcs/pkcs11.so
    make

This creates a _dnie-pkcs11-tester_ in the current directory you can execute.

If you want you can compile by yourself (maybe it is easier) just execute a command like this:

    gcc -I. dnie-pkcs11-tester.c -o dnie-pkcs11-tester \
    -Wl,-rpath=/path/to/pkcs /path/to/pkcs/pkcs11.so -lcrypto

The _rpath_ is important to fix that pkcs11 library to the resulting binary (you can also use LD_PRELOAD if you do not want to use rpath).

Finally the current status of the tests which are executed is the following:

    -l Login test: Test the login into the DNIe.
    -o List objects test: Lists all objects in DNIe and try to 
       find the required ones (certificate, private and public 
       key for the siging and authentication keys)
    -s Sign test: Performs a signature and a verification with the sign keys.
    -t Auth test: Performs a signature and a verification with the authentication keys.
    -i Interference test: Exeutes two processes in that way that one steals the
       secure channel of the other after the login (some sleeps are used for that).
       This test is 60 seconds in length.
    -a All tests: Performs all the tests one by one.
